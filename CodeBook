Overview
=================

This code book indicates all variables of 'tidy.txt'.
Variables of 'tidy.txt' are derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data is collected from the accelerometers of the smartphone Samsung Galaxy S II. It is based on experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. The data was captured while each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone on the waist. 


Identifier variables
=================

There are two identifier variables:

subject - The ID of each subject: Integer values: 1:30
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken: Factor Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING


Measurement Features 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

A large set of variables were estimated from these signals in the original data, but for this project only following were kept in the data: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

We also kept following vectors, obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample:
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The resulting measurement variable names differ somewhat from the original form in order to use appropriate labels. Measurement variables have the following form: tBodyAccmeanX, which means the mean value of tBodyAcc-XYZ.

Compared to the original data, all variables now represent mean values of multiple measurements of the original variables aggregated across the variables 'subject' as well as 'activity'. 

Note: features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
